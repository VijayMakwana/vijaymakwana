A Flutter codebase for portfolio web and app creation. I have created my portfolio web using this
simple flutter code. Here is my portfolio website: https://vijaymakwana-87453.web.app/

This website supports Light and dark theme. Also Its fully dynamic based on color you pass on
colorscheme seed. For me Its Green, But you can use any color you want.

This website is deployed using firebase web hosting. you can
checkout https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting for how to deploy web using firebase.

You can create your own portfolio website using this codebase. You just need to clone this repo,
replace your details and deploy.
